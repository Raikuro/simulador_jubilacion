"""Black-box E2E: the ``sim-retire`` CLI reproduces the ERN SWR Part 1 oracle.

Acceptance criterion (P4.9, extended by P4.11): running the public ``sim-retire``
CLI on the committed ERN datasets yields success rates that agree with the
independent ERN oracle matrix (``data/ern/p49_oracle_table.csv``) within +/-1
percentage point, with the three published anchors (95 / 65 / 97) as hard-fail
checks.

The test exercises ONLY the public CLI as an external subprocess, exactly as a
user would:

  ``sim-retire --data-dir data/ern run <grid.yaml> --workers max
  --no-persist --summary-only``

The whole ERN SWR grid is a SINGLE study: one YAML, one ResearchPlan of
313,020 units, one subprocess, one observable summary with one
machine-parseable ``cell:`` line per parameter configuration.  The test parses
those lines, maps each to ``(equity_allocation, withdrawal_rate, horizon_years)``
and compares every cell against the pinned oracle.

The grid runs in non-persistent, summary-only mode: no SQLite study database is
created and per-month timelines are never materialized or transferred.

Enable with ``RUN_ERN_E2E=1``; the full 180-cell grid also needs
``RUN_ERN_E2E_FULL=1``.  The fast-path acceptance check needs
``ERN_E2E_FAST_PATH=1``; the reference-chained checks need
``ERN_E2E_REFERENCE_CHAINED=1``.  The default worker selection when
``ERN_E2E_WORKERS`` is unset is the conservative ``min(8, cpu_count)``;
``ERN_E2E_WORKERS=N`` pins an exact override count and ``ERN_E2E_WORKERS=max``
requests every available logical CPU.
